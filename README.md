# VarjoDesigns.com with React and Node.js 

Portfolio piece using React!  There will be a Node.js backend related to this project that will be published as an separate repository


**Project intentions**

I created this repository to showcase some of the technical skills i've acquired in React. I'm also practicing committing with descriptions and in a structured manner. Although I do know how to create pull requests and multiple forks, i decided against it for now as I will be working on the project alone for foreseeable future.


**So what is it going to be? **

This will be a single page version of my website, using React and Node.js. I'm making it as a training project but will probably end up using it as the active site on www.varjodesigns.com as soon as i get the visuals looking good.


**Features**

Listing items using arrays (supports backend integration at later date)

Contact form that will be sent to backend in future versions & displays the current submit using events


**Application backend**

https://github.com/VarjoDesigns/NodeVD

Please note that backend has not been integrated yet. I'll need to add fetch for backend sourced listing
