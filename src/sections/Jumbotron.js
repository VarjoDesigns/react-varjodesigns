                Varjo Designs is an alias I use for exploring world of graphics design. I specialize in motorsports and mainly focus on doing projects I care about – stuff that excites me or inspires me to do something new, something different, something beautiful.

                I’m quite flexible when it comes to different medias for expressing my style – always willing to learn new things and use my love for motorsport and design as a way to push through - even if it sometimes seems as if I have bitten something I might not be able to chew! If you are enthusiastic about cars or design, or if you might have a cool project for me, please don't hesitate to contact me!
