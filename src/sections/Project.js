import React from 'react';

export default function Project () {

    return(
        <div>
            <h2>
                 General information about this web project
            </h2>
            <p>
                I intend to make this a scalable React project in the sens ethat most of the listed items are imported as an array and not hardcoded into the UI
            </p>
            <p>
                There might be a web form if I use this for a school project on the side, but I don't intend to have one on the final site.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not too concerned about the visual outcome - this one is mostly a showcase of technical ability.
            </p>

        </div>
