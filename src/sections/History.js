                I have been making race car liveries in Forza Motorsport since my early teens. I was fascinated by all the pretty race liveries people were running on their cars online, and needed to get some cool liveries for myself as well. Good liveries were hard to come by so I started making my own decals and liveries from early on... The early ones were pretty dismal, but over the years I've certainly grown wiser and found my own style!

                I started learning illustrator few years back as I wanted to be able to do pretty illustrations and maybe realize my dream of designing an actual race car. Turns out illustrating cars took a lot of time, which wasn't an issue as a full time student but is pretty much unmanageable by now! I still use Illustrator a lot though, for various design needs such as logos, website components etc.
